To make sure the walls you trace over the image come up in the correct scale, you must set the image's resolution in pixels per meter _(px/m)_. To do so, click/release on one end of the wall. As you move the mouse, an orange line will appear as shown below. Click/release at the end of the wall to complete the line. Once you successfully set the resolution, click on "Ok" and the 2D map plan image you selected should show up in the 2D-View area.
